  {title: "My Portfolio Website | Rails/React+Redux", content: "<p>Hi everyone! Well, this is finally it. After a year and a half of hacking away at Flatiron’s online self-paced software engineering course, I’ve finished my last project. The crux of the course. A “magnum opus.” The most frustrating, bug-ridden $%\#$@#….well, nevermind. I DID IT!</p><p>For my final project, I decided to build something that would help kickstart my career in web development. Using a Rails API backend and React + Redux on the frontend, I created my very own portfolio website to showcase my previous work at Flatiron, my blog posts, and my future work as a developer.</p><p>That’s right, my portfolio project is a portfolio. 🤯</p><h2>Video Walkthrough</h2><p>I’ll add a link here when I get to the walkthrough tonight, Feb 14th 2021…</p><h2>Rails API Overview</h2><p>My backend is fairly simple. I have 5 tables: users, posts, comments, tags, and posts_tags (a join table to create a belongs_to_and_has_many relationship between posts and tags). While the primary user on this application is me (as an admin), people are able to signup on my website to post comments on my projects and blog. Here is my schema.db file:</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">create_table \"comments\", force: :cascade do |t|\n    t.text \"content\"\n    t.integer \"post_id\"\n    t.datetime \"created_at\", precision: 6, null: false\n    t.datetime \"updated_at\", precision: 6, null: false\n    t.integer \"user_id\"\n  end\n\n  create_table \"posts\", force: :cascade do |t|\n    t.string \"title\"\n    t.text \"content\"\n    t.integer \"user_id\"\n    t.datetime \"created_at\", precision: 6, null: false\n    t.datetime \"updated_at\", precision: 6, null: false\n    t.string \"category\"\n    t.string \"image_link\"\n  end\n\n  create_table \"posts_tags\", id: false, force: :cascade do |t|\n    t.bigint \"post_id\", null: false\n    t.bigint \"tag_id\", null: false\n    t.index [\"post_id\", \"tag_id\"], name: \"index_posts_tags_on_post_id_and_tag_id\"\n  end\n\n  create_table \"tags\", force: :cascade do |t|\n    t.string \"name\"\n    t.datetime \"created_at\", precision: 6, null: false\n    t.datetime \"updated_at\", precision: 6, null: false\n  end\n\n  create_table \"users\", force: :cascade do |t|\n    t.string \"name\"\n    t.string \"email\"\n    t.text \"description\"\n    t.string \"password_digest\"\n    t.datetime \"created_at\", precision: 6, null: false\n    t.datetime \"updated_at\", precision: 6, null: false\n    t.boolean \"admin\", default: false\n  end\n</pre><p>I’ve been comfortable working with Rails for a while now, so the backend was a breeze to set up! Once I got all of my associations working, controllers, and models built, the only maintaince I had to do throughout this project was update my JSON serializers to render the information I needed on the frontend.</p><h2>Frontend Overview (ReactJS + Redux)</h2><p>My frontend using React + Redux was a HUGE learning experience for me. While I breezed through the React and Redux sections in the course, I never really quite understood complex they were until I began coding my project. The first hurdle I had to get over was the project structure using containers, components, actions, and reducers. It took me a long time to understand the “flow” and be comfortable implementing new features.</p><p>As I coded along, my project became riddled with files and I had to condense the project into even MORE folders. Holy cow, talk about a lot to keep track of. While I love the idea behind Redux, it surely makes you code a ton to even build the simplest of features.</p><p>From the basic user, my frontend looks simple and minimalistic. I have a home page, project page, post page, and resume page. In addition to this, there are signup and login components for users wanting to comment on my posts.</p><p>From the admin side, the site gets a lot more complex. Admins on my website have access to a full dashboard, which includes a post/project builder, editor, user accounts manager, and tag manager. The “backend of the frontend” is a fully operational CMS (content management system) for myself, much like Wordpress!</p><p>While I won’t go into specific details of my containers, components, actions, and reducers (feel free to scour my code&nbsp;<a href=\"http://github.com/slaydenriley/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">here</a>), I do want to point out one feature on the frontend that I’m very proud of: my&nbsp;<strong>rich text editor.</strong></p><h2>Rich Text Editor using Quill</h2><p>Because I was creating a CMS for myself, I wanted to be able to&nbsp;<em>style</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>design</em>&nbsp;my blog posts the way I wanted them to appear on the web, just like you would do with Wordpress or Medium. So, I began researching how this could be possible. I came across “Rich Text Editors,” which essentially convert styled content into HTML that can be saved as a string to the database. Upon render, the HTML string is converted back into straight HTML and displayed on the page. Cool!</p><p>I found that the Quill Editor would best suit my needs, so I went ahead and installed it with npm. After some configuration and troubleshooting, I got what I accomplished, a fully functioning rich text editor!</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ItKpiAp.png\" alt=\"image\"></p><p>And there we go! As a published post, it is styled exactly how I did it in my editor.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ecWTmEc.png\"></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I’ve learned so much at my time at Flatiron and I’m incredibly excited to continue my education as I transition into a new career. This portfolio project was at times frustrating, rewarding, complicated, and enjoyable, but overall I am so happy to be comfortable with React and Redux now, and I can’t wait to dive even deeper into those technologies.</p><p>Please feel free to check out my code&nbsp;<a href=\"http://github.com/slaydenriley/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">here.</a></p><p>If you’re working through your React/Redux project, or any other project at Flatiron for that matter, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need some motivation.</p><p>-Riley Slayden</p>", category: "post", image_link: "https://i.imgur.com/6jno1XU.png"},

  {title: "Banjo Market - Sinatra App", content: "<p>Hi everyone! For my second porfolio project for Flatiron, I decided to extend the theme from my first CLI project: banjos! I set out to build a used banjo marketplace website using Sinatra.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This is what I wanted my app to do:</strong></p><ul><li>Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) both banjos and users</li><li>Allow users to login, edit their profile, and view other user’s profiles (and not edit them!)</li><li>When a user account gets deleted, their listings get deleted too</li><li>A non logged in user can only view ‘/login’ page and ‘/signup’ page</li><li>When an error occurs during account creation/editing, display a flash message to the user (e.g. “Your passwords do not match!”)</li><li>Have an overall visually pleasing asthetic (a challenge considering this was my first time doing anything front-end!)</li></ul><p>I began by building a very basic MVC, to first CRUD users. Once I figured out the routing, I began building CRUD for banjo listings.</p><p>My models used a :has_many, :belongs_to relationship. This is where I ran into my first confusing error. For some reason, I wasn’t able to connect the users to their listings. When a new listing was created, its user_id was not correlating with the user that created it.</p><p><br></p><p>So, after quite a bit of research on Google and Stack Overflow, I found my problem, WHICH WAS SO OBVIOUS. I never created a column in the banjos table for a users_id. And thus, I created a new migration to add a users_id column and my association issue was solved.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything after that was smooth-sailing. Once I got all of the backend part of the application written, I moved onto the front-end aspect: HTML, erb, and CSS.</p><p>The front-end development was much easier than I expected, considering I had very little experience with it. There are some incredible resources for CSS and HTML help online, and this proved to be very helpful to me. While I created a fairly good looking deskop site, my CSS responsiveness for different screens was not perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>Moving into the future, I now have a much better understanding on how to structure HTML to make for easier CSS styling and responsiveness.</p><p><strong>Here are a couple screenshots from a logged in user:</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yyvCj9U.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zXsFn3P.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3aZ6t9u.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zMnVioi.png\"></p><p>Much like my first portfolio project, beginning this Sinatra project was extremely daunting at first. I did not feel like I understood Sinatra and ActiveRecord enough to be able to build my own app. But, I’ve found that I learn best when I am building a project of my own and researching the problems and errors that go along with it.</p><p><br></p><p>And with that said, if you are feeling nervous about the Sinatra project, YOU CAN DO IT! You will figure it out and you will learn a ton in the process.</p><p>Thanks for reading!

  {title: "CLI Portfolio Project, stelling_banjos", content: "<p>While coding consumes many hours of my day, my true “day job” is not as a student at Flatiron. It is, rather, as a professional banjo player. Throughout the year, I travel around the country with my band “National Park Radio” and play music for thousands of people at festivals, breweries, bars, houses, parks…you name it.</p><p><br></p><p>That being said, I am OBSESSED with banjos. Specifically, Stelling banjos, which I believe are the best banjos ever built. So for my CLI Data Gem porfolio project, I thought it would be fun to create a “Stelling Banjo Catalog” which people could use to view all the Stelling banjos for sale on elderly.com, get the price, and optionally view more information about each banjo.</p><p><br></p><h1>Building My&nbsp;<em>stelling_banjos</em>&nbsp;Gem</h1><p><br></p><p>Before beginning this project, I was incredibly nervous. I felt like I did not understand enough about OO Ruby to actually build a gem of my own.

  {title: "Rails + JS Portfolio Project: Music Market", content: "<p>For my Rails API and Javascript portfolio project, I created an app called “Music Market” which allows users to sell their used instruments to other users. Thus far, all of my Flatiron portfolio projects have employed a music theme, so I had to continue on with this project. :)</p><p>Before I go over the details of Music Market, let me first say that this was the most challenging project I’ve had to create at Flatiron. For whatever reason, it took me MONTHS to wrap my head around Javascript, especially after working for so long with Rails. While there are many similarities between Rails and Javascript, the small differences in syntax between the two completely threw me off.

Please check password.\",\n            status: 400\n          }\n          render :json =&gt; payload, :status =&gt; :bad_request\n        end\n    end\n\n    def destroy\n        if session[:user_id]\n            reset_session\n        end\n    end\nend\n</pre><p>That’s the basic overview of my Rails API! It was simple for me to setup and provides the basic structure required to support a JS frontend.</p><h2>Vanilla Javascript Frontend Overview</h2><p>As I stated before, JS was very difficult for me to learn. I found, however, that the more I worked on this project, the clearer it became to me.</p><p>I first started coding my frontend in a single file,&nbsp;<em>index.js</em>. However, this QUICKLY filled up with code and became incredibly confusing to read and navigate. I began thinking how I could break it up to separate my concerns. Coming from Rails, I really enjoyed using a MVC (model, view, controller) structure. Therefore, I broke up my code like this:</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">Frontend\n    Fetchers\n\t     listing_fetcher.js\n\t     session_fetcher.js\n\t\t   user_fetcher.js\n\t\t\n    Views\n\t\t   app.js\n\t\t   listing.js\n\t\t   users.js\n</pre><p>As you can see, I separated my code between Fetchers and Views, listings and users. This helped me a TON and kept my code neat and clean. Each of these files used Javascript classes as well, so everything was nicely organized and easy to call upon from other files.</p><p>Here is an example of some fetch code:</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">// // USER FETCHER COMMUNICATES WITH RAILS API FOR USES //\nclass UserFetcher {\n  constructor() {\n    this.fetchUsers();\n  };\n\n  fetchUsers() {\n    fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/users`)\n    .then(users =&gt; users.json())\n    .then(users =&gt; Users.renderUsers(users))\n  };\n\n  static fetchSingleUser(id) {\n    fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/users/${id}`)\n    .then(user =&gt; user.json())\n    .then(user =&gt; Users.renderSingleUser(user))\n  };\n\n// PATCH REQUEST TO EDIT USER //\nstatic editUser() {\n  let name = document.querySelector(\"#edit_name\").value;\n  let username = document.querySelector(\"#edit_username\").value;\n  let description = document.querySelector(\"#edit_description\").value;\n  let email = document.querySelector(\"#edit_email\").value;\n  let password = document.querySelector(\"#edit_password\").value;\n  let password_confirmation = document.querySelector(\"#edit_password_confirm\").value;\n  let id = current_user_id\n\n  let formData = {\n    name: name,\n    username: username,\n    email: email,\n    description: description,\n    password: password,\n    password_confirmation: password_confirmation,\n    id: id\n  };\n\n  let configObj = {\n     method: \"PATCH\",\n     headers: {\n         \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n         \"Accept\": \"application/json\"\n       },\n       body: JSON.stringify(formData)\n    };\n\n    fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/users`, configObj)\n    .then(user =&gt; user.json())\n    .then(function(user) {\n      if (user.status === 400) {\n        let error_message = document.querySelector(\".edit_user_error_message\")\n        error_message.innerHTML = \"\"\n        error_message.innerHTML += `&lt;p class=\"error_message\"&gt;${user.error}&lt;/p&gt;`\n        loginForm.style.display = \"block\"\n      }\n      else {\n        Users.renderSingleUser(user)\n      };\n    });\n\n};\n};\n</pre><p>And here is an example of some view code:</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">// USER INSTANCE CREATED WHEN LOGGED IN FROM APP CLASS //\nclass Users {\n  constructor() {\n    this.listeners();\n  };\n\n// LISTENS FOR BUTTON CLICKS //\n  listeners() {\n    users.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n      let user = new UserFetcher\n      App.removeActiveButton()\n      users.classList.add(\"active_button\")\n    });\n    account.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n      UserFetcher.fetchSingleUser(current_user_id)\n      App.removeActiveButton()\n      account.classList.add(\"active_button\")\n    });\n  };\n\n// RENDERS ALL USERS //\n  static renderUsers(users) {\n    App.clearMain();\n    allUsers.style.display = \"block\";\n\n    users.forEach(user =&gt;
